photo-unique
-----------------

A simple multithread script to create an unique photo library. The script is made up of three components:
 * Main thread
 * Indexing thread
 * Db thread

Main thread
--------------
Walk thru a filesystem to find images, then pass their path to one of the indexing threads


Indexing threads
-----------------
Every indexing thread creates an image perceptual hash and pass it to the Db thread. This job is quite slow, so it's parallelized.

Db thread
-----------
Write indexes to the db in the following form: 
{ hash : path}

It's in a separate thread to avoid locking issues. Only this thread plays with db.
